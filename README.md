# Scratch-Hexapawn
## Preamble *I think that is what this is called*

A few days ago I was watching youTube, and I stumbbled across this videa. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw7UAZNgGg8
I thought that this would be fun to code, but I thought that coding it regularly would be to easy. As a result I coded it on scratch. It was a monstrocity, and is possibly the longest scratch code I have ever written. *That is not saying alot*

## Running it
I am not sure why you would want to do this, but you can either just use this link. : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/740647432
Or you can just upload the file attatched to project to scratch to run it.

## How to play. 
Pres the pawn that you want to move, (They move like in chess) And press the up arrow to move up. right arrow to move diagonally right up, and left arrow to do similar. The code should always win, and please give like a 3 second wait after the computer play, and please do not try to break the game. (Or do, sometimes it is fun). Or just watch this video.
